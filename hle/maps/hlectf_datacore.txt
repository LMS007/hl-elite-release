A capture the flag version of the valve released map datacore. 
This map pits Red and Blue teams against each other. The flag 
is in the upper room with the desk. The teams start spread out 
across the 3 large rooms on each side of the map. There are 5 
passages to access the flag room the two going to the long jump 
room are the fastest and usually safest way the offense can get 
to and from the flag. Keep your team organized and help the 
defense with supplies so they can concentrate on locking down 
the flag room.
