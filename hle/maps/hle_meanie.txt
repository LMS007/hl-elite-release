Op4_meanie was one of the most popular and original maps for 
Opposing Forces. With this tribute to the map we bring it to 
Half-Life Elite. It is a tall vertically oriented map vertical 
movement is important. The teleport at the bottom of the map 
will take you to the upper blue room and all players will be 
able to hear when the teleport has been used.  The majority 
of spawns are in the green room while more of the supplies 
are on the other side of the map. Each player starts with a 
long jump in addition to the usual handgun and crowbar.
