Boot_Camp is the most popular and most played hldm map ever made. 
I put together a ctf map that would attract players from both the 
hldm, op4dm and op4ctf community's. I built this map very close to
scale. I did this so people who are familiar with the map could play
it like normal boot_camp. The majority of spawns are in the bridge house
behind a force field while more of the spawns are located near the truck 
and around the perimeter of the bridge house. Supplies are placed all around
the map.
