It is a tall vertically oriented map vertical movement is 
important. Green and Blue teams each start on their side of 
the map stocked with a long jump, handgun, and crowbar.  The 
teleports at the bottom of the map will take you to the flag 
room and all players will be able to hear when the teleport 
has been used. The teleport can be easily accessed from the 
center of the map; however do not try to take a flag through 
the teleport. It will probably be quite easy to steal the flag, 
capturing the flag will be much harder. You must move the flag 
back through the room the opposition starts in and each main 
area of the map. If you fall down or are tactically forced to 
go down you will have to use the bounce pads to get the flag 
up into your flag room.
