This map is designed for CTF, but it works with TLMS, TACTION, DUEL, LMS, and ACTION modes. 
Two teams permitted, Green vs Purple. The main button in each base activates lasers which block 
all opposing players from moving through them. If they have the flag the flag will be turned when
killed by the lasers.
