// Do not exceed numbers greater then 2 digits or letters including the (-) negative sign.  Thus -10 will not work, but -5 will.
// The weight determines if a new weapon will switch with the one in your hand when you pick it up. 
// It simply compares the weight of your current weapon with the new weapon you picked up.
// Any weapon(s) missing here will be replaced by the valve default weight.
